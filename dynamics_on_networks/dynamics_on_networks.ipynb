    "# Dynamics on Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Authors: Mauricio Barahona and Robert Peach\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying a dynamical process, we are concerned with its behavior as a function of time, space, and its parameters. We may want to examine how many people are infected by a biological contagion and whether it persists from one season to another, whether and to what extent interacting oscillators synchronize, whether a meme on the internet becomes viral or not, and more. Common to these systems is that the dynamics are occurring on a discrete set of entities, i.e., on the nodes of a network, that are connected to each other in some non-trivial way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world systems may be described as a network of dynamically interacting entities. Social networks facilitate the propagation of rumours and the spread of pathogens; the powergrid that connect our cities and homes enable the flow of electrical energy; our economies are supported by the micro-economic trading between individuals and businesses. Common to these systems is that the dynamics are occurring on a discrete set of entities, i.e., on the nodes of a network, that are connected to each other in some non-trivial way. Understanding the dynamics of these systems is essential if we are to redesign them, or guide/control them towards different behaviours. \n",

    "![title](images/london_underground.gif)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:center\">The london underground is a physical transport system that can be modelled as a network.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally we can ask **how non-trivial connectivity, and thus the topology of our network structures, affects dynamical processes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Not only can network structure affect dynamical processes on a network, but also that dynamical processes can affect the dynamics of the network itself. For example, when a child gets the flu, he/she might not go to school for a couple of days, and this temporary change in human activity affects which social contacts take place, which can in turn affect the dynamics of disease propagation. We won't touch on the dynamics of networks, i.e., networks changing over time, but we emphasise that this is also an interesting area that is little explored in network science.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What do we touch on in this notebook?\n",
    "We will look at a couple of examples of fundamental dynamical phenomena over networked systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will apply the Kuramoto model on networks.\n",
    "2. Look at epidemiological infection models on networks.\n",
    "3. Understand how network topology governs dynamical processes.\n"

    "## Synchronisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon, universally found both in natural and human-engineered systems. From firing neurons to the twinkling of fireflies, from metronomes to power grids, from applauding audiences to the circadian rhythms of plants and animals. All of these systems display similar synchronization behaviors. Patterns and order magically emerge from the disordered interplay of many interacting parts, with a complexity\n",
    "which seems to give no hope for simple models. As it often happens in complex systems, however, their obvious differences fade away when the phenomenon is examined at the right scale and with the right level of abstraction. The way synchronization occurs seems to be independent of whether the agents are singing crickets, heart cells or metronomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Systems of oscillators\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the angle that the oscillator makes with the x-axis at some time $t$ as $\\theta(t) = \\omega t + \\theta_0$, where $ω$ is the natural frequency of the oscillator. If we have $n$ different *isolated* oscillators, each with its own natural frequency $\\omega_i ∈ R$, we can describe the evolution of the system with the ordinary system of differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\dot{\\theta} = \\omega\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We stress the word “isolated” because, up to this point, no interaction is considered. The\n",
    "oscillators are each evolving as by their nature, with no external disruptions!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interacting oscillators: Kuramoto model \n",
    "\n",
    "We now come to the central point of explaining how it is possible for a system of oscillators to synchronize. Why do metronomes on a moving platform, each set with its own tempo (natural frequency), synchronize after a few beats? The reason is to be found in their interactions. In each of the synchronizing systems mentioned above, one finds that the oscillators are always coupled, in the sense that they exchange information about their phase. This\n",
    "could mean different things depending on the specific system: the metronomes are coupled through the slight movements and vibrations of the moving platform, the fireflies can see each other’s light, and the applauding crowd can feel the movement of their seats induced by the applause itself. No matter how weak, interactions disrupt the natural behavior of oscillators, allowing for the emergence of a variety of interesting collective phenomena, of which synchronization is just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kuramoto model consists of a population of oscillators whose phases are all-to-all coupled. Lets now modify the equation above to include this all-to-all interacting oscillators:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\dot \\theta_i = \\omega_i - \\sigma \\sum_j \\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)\\, .\n",
    "    \\label{eq:kuramoto}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly added term on the right hand side tells us that the evolution of the phase of oscillator $i$ is disrupted by the interaction between oscillator $i$ and every other oscillator $j$, modulated by the coupling or interaction strength $\\sigma > 0$. First notice that, by the properties of the sine function, the interaction between oscillators $i$ and $j$ will be 0 when $\\theta_i − \\theta_j = k\\pi$ i.e. when $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ represent the same angle (in-phase synchronization).\n",
